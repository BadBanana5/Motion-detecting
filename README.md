# Motion-detecting
This is a project where I used an arduino ESP32 with a PIR motion detector to both update a self hosted web server and send messages through signals api to my phone to update me when motion is detected.

I had to work around constraints like:
The apiâ€™s limit of 40 messages per 4 hours.
I also had to overcome the challenge of updating the web server's html to display; the new motion detected, a counter of all detection and a call to a different website to the current time for the detection.
